        <strong>Conceptual Note</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>In recent years, there has been a growing emphasis on improving the quality of higher education institutions 
                    (HEIs) in many countries around the world. This is driven by the recognition that HEIs are crucial in producing
                    skilled and knowledgeable graduates, advancing research and innovation, and promoting economic growth and social
                    development.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    To institutionalise a quality culture in HEIs, it is important to focus on four key plenary topics. First, 
                    enhancing research quality in HEIs requires a focus on assessment and improvement strategies that promote the 
                    highest standards of research excellence. This includes investing in research infrastructure, supporting 
                    interdisciplinary collaborations, and ensuring that research outputs are rigorous, relevant, and impactful.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Second, enhancing higher education quality through information communication & technology (ICT) is essential for
                    ensuring students receive a world-class education that prepares them for the digital age. This includes leveraging
                    ICT to enhance teaching and learning, promoting digital literacy among students and faculty, and leveraging data 
                    analytics to support evidence-based decision-making.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Third, strategic approaches of HEIs towards achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are crucial for ensuring
                    that HEIs play a proactive role in addressing the major global challenges of our time, such as climate change, 
                    poverty, and inequality. This includes integrating sustainability into the curriculum, promoting community engagement 
                    and partnerships, and measuring and reporting on the impact of HEIs on the SDGs.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Finally, the Higher Education Institution's strategies for implementing the National Education Policy (NEP) are 
                    critical for ensuring that HEIs align with the national education agenda and contribute to national development goals. 
                    This includes promoting academic freedom and autonomy, ensuring that HEIs are inclusive and equitable, and leveraging 
                    innovative approaches to teaching and learning that foster creativity and critical thinking.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Overall, institutionalising a quality culture in HEIs requires a multifaceted approach that focuses on research 
                    quality, ICT, SDGs, and NEP. By addressing these key plenary topics, HEIs can position themselves as leaders 
                    in the global knowledge economy and contribute to a more sustainable and equitable future for all.

            <strong>Objectives</strong>
            <p>In the move toward enhancing quality in higher education in general and universities in specific, the National 
            Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) has introduced a new assessment and accreditation process since 
            July 2017. Considering the character of its process that encompasses both qualitative and quantitative dimensions 
            and represents an explicit Paradigm Shift making it ICT enabled, objective, transparent, scalable and robust. There
            is an urgent need to build competencies of IQAC members at the institutional level and to develop an understanding
            of the nuances involved in the current process of assessment and accreditation.
            </p>
            <p>It is essential to create a deeper understanding of quality related to data mining, data capturing across the 
            NAAC framework and its specific criteria so that the institutions develop new benchmarks and best practices. 
            The capacities of key personnel driving quality initiatives in their respective institutions are to be developed 
            and nurtured. Hence the seminar on NAAC Assessment and Accreditation- Building Institutional Competencies will 
            focus on issues related to how institutions can develop their self-improvement initiatives to promote innovation 
            and strengthen quality in their respective institutions.
            </p>

            <strong>Outcome </strong>

                    Through the seminar the competencies of key personnel in universities/institutions with regard to quality 
                    awareness will be identified and efforts will be made to disseminate and transfer quality ideas to all concerned 
                    in their respective institutions. As a key outcome institutions will gain increased awareness on the overall 
                    approach to the new NAAC quality Framework.

                Government of India headquartered in Bangalore.  NAAC was established in 1994 in response to recommendations 
                of National Policy in Education (1986). This policy was to "address the issues of deterioration in quality of 
                education", and the Programme of Action (POA-1992) laid out strategic plans for the policies including the 
                establishment of an independent national accreditation body. Consequently, the NAAC was established in 1994 
                with its headquarters at Bengaluru.
